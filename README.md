# Project Overview


## Step 1: Setting Up
### Conceptualized
* Discussed logical next steps to extend our previous research.
* Discussed where machine learning and big data manipulation would work best.
### Scoped out data to support a plan
* Found fields provided by OpenLibrary API
### Collaboration SetUp
* Set up DataBricks Workspace
* Set up GitHub Repository

## Step 2: Gathering, Cleaning, and Processing Data
###  Data Sources
* Open Library
* Previous NYT Bestseller List Data

### Cleaned and Processed Data
* Pulled LOTS of data from Open Library to flesh out the NYT Bestsellers data already acquired.
* Removed columns that were unnecessary.
* Filtered dataset down to books published after 2008 and printed in English.
